My name is Hongyi Xia and I am an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Maryland, College Park graduating in May 2015. I am looking for an entry level Aerospace Engineer position at Lockheed Martin.

From September 2013 to August 2014, I interned at Space Exploration Technologies in Hawthorne, California as a Propulsion Intern. I supported engine development for the Falcon 9 rocket, developed 3D visualization software, and performed thermal and fluids analysis for the rocket.

My previous work experience was mostly in research and heavily programming based. I have worked extensively in Matlab, for class projects, my honors research involving a computer vision algorithm to track vortex shedding, a project using Microsoft Kinect to visualize flow fields, modeling the dynamics of hexbug behavior and so on. In high school, I took 3 years of Java in which I received a 5 on the AP Computer Science AB exam and completed courses such as Computational Methods and Computer Graphics. My Java experience laid the foundation for me to quickly learn other languages such as Python, C++, OpenGL when required for a project despite the fact that computer programming is not a focus in our Aerospace curriculum. The ability to quickly pick up new technologies is crucial to being a successful technology analyst due to constantly evolving nature of the technology field.
